# New Year Countdown

I used HTML to provide the structure and content of the countdown, and CSS to style its appearance. Then, using JS, I was able to handle the countdown's functionality by utilizing built-in date and time functions.

One of the coolest features of my New Year's countdown is how it dynamically updates every second, showing the exact amount of time until the new year. Anyone who uses it will have a fun and interactive experience.

I believe that my project is a great example of the power of web development, as it allows anyone with an internet connection to access and interact with my New Year countdown. Overall, I'm really proud of what I've accomplished, and I hope that my project inspires others to create their own engaging and interactive applications using web development technologies.

## Getting Started

## New Things I Learned

Date() objects may be produced in nine different ways, and I particularly liked the new Date (year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds).

I also learned that JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11: January has a value of zero. December has a value of 11. Also, if you don’t pass anything to Date(), it will return today’s date.

Found out about the getTime() method and how, by default, it returns the amount of milliseconds that have passed since January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00. But, I was able to locate any date I wanted when I coupled it with Date().

## Challenges I faced

I chose 01 for January because I was unaware that the Date() object only accepts the months 0 to 11, so I received the incorrect amount of days. But, I quickly realised what was going on and changed it to 00 to receive the correct number of days for January.
